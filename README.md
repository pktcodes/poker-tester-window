Coming to this project, you can have any poker hand like pair, flush, etc., and represented with card images depending upon the uncommenting the line of code. The major part of the code has been provided by the course mentor and I have modified to make it work.

I have made this project as part of my coursework CS214 - Principles of Computer Science.
